       "  'abstract': \"The use of CAs can be applied to educational settings to better support teaching and learning and alternative learning environments. Computing underpins almost all areas of the modern world and many new opportunities in science and engineering could not have been realized without it. Thus, computer scientists have the potential to revolutionize societies, develop economic wealth and change people’s lives. Employers needs to ensure that its future generations have the skills that employers require, which is only achieved through effective teaching and learning practices at our schools. If we do not engage at this level, we are unlikely to produce the number of computer scientists required to satisfy the demands of industry. Teachers need support from the science community and industry to increase the number of students leaving school confident in coding, algorithmic thinking and computer science.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence within teaching and learning is an opportunity to seek novel ways to deliver curriculum content. This may come in the form of conversational agents or learning companions using adaptive learning methodologies. Like an imaginary friend, learning companions can accompany students — asking questions, providing encouragement, offering suggestions and connections to resources, and help talk through difficulties. Over time, the companion would 'learn' what you know, what interests you, and what kind of learner you are. Such research would raise ethical questions to the use of AI applications alongside human educators; however it is a challenge that will impact profoundly on the nature of teaching and learning? There is enormous potential for such research that remains unrealised along with its associated benefits. AI will empower teachers which will better inform them on how to manage the learning of their students.\\n\\nThe use of AI agents using natural language dialogue may provide a means to support different types of conversations and thus learning styles. The premise for such agents is to guide students through the questioning process as opposed to simply proving an answer. Students will gain independence by answering questions for themselves through appropriate dialogue.\"},\n",

Both contribute to meeting accreditation criteria, and play into the employability agenda. itSM is prominent both in the SFIA framework and in the BCS Breadth of Knowledge test for CITP. Yet, unlike project management, itSM is integrated into only a handful of undergraduate computing degree programmes.\\n\\nThe principal challenge arises from the pedagogies and expectations of certification schemes and training courses being fundamentally different from those of higher education. itSM training courses seek to help participants engage with and enhance an existing service oriented working environment. For HE, the objective is to develop a deep understanding of the value and fundamental importance of itSM within the broad context of computing, and on understanding the reasons and justifications for effective itSM. The pedagogy needs also to encourage students to understand the risks of ignoring itSM – as with the risks of ignoring project management or the principles of software engineering.\\nWe present some challenges and questions encountered during the Open University’s development of itSM distance learning material for undergraduate Computing students. In a distance learning environment, the distinctions in objectives and pedagogy between certification and higher education are exacerbated by the limited opportunities for face-to-face discussions. Furthermore, the student body is disparate: some work in the sector, some are school-leavers with no work experience, and others work in completely different sectors.\\n\\nWe present our solution to these challenges: a “caricature” pedagogy that emphasises the intended outcomes and benefits of IT service management, rather than its nomenclature, based on the classic ITIL service lifecycle. Our experience, including student reaction, suggests that this approach could enable the wider adoption of itSM teaching in university computing courses.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Graduate Level Apprenticeships (GLAs) are undergraduate degrees in which the students are in full-time employment, studying on campus one day per week. In September 2017, our university\\'s first cohort of apprentices began degrees in Software Development, Cybersecurity, and Information Technology Management for Business. Apprentices complete undergraduate honours degrees in four years—the standard duration for a Scottish university. This is achieved by running modules through the summer and through Professional Practice modules: work-based learning, completed in the workplace. The students are paid employees, throughout, and their place on the course is dependent on their job. In contrast, many of our undergraduate students have to balance paid work, un-related to their degree, with their studies, and take out student loans. The fees of the apprentices and other Scottish-domiciled undergraduates are paid by the Scottish Government.\\n\\nThis study investigates the apprentices\\' perceptions of these new degrees, focusing on their motivations, self-identity, and the challenge of balancing employment with their studies. This is contextualised by gathering parallel data from undergraduate students studying similar subjects, who have part-time jobs. Three qualitative research methods are used with each of these two groups of students: a short survey, a Rich Picture session, and semi-structured interviews. Reay, Crozier, and Clayton (2010) describe a spectrum of university student identities, from students at elite universities, where being a university student becomes the individual’s main source of identity, to students at their local post-1992 university, who try to balance paid work and family commitments with study. This results in diverse learner identities, from those who have a strong sense of themselves as successful learners to those whose learner identities are \"fragile and unconfident\" (p.9). This presentation reports on students\\' identities as both learners and employees, comparing the contexts of an integrated apprenticeship degree with undergraduate students managing additional part-time work.'},\n",

A higher education institution is impacted by many influences, such as structured educational opportunities for students at all levels (BSc – PhD), accountability to fee payers, setting differentiation between higher education organisation and other educational institutions. In the UK 'education for all' is an inspirational cry by many a politician; a government agenda in such endeavours is not only from a moral and ethical viewpoint but is also driven by economic need to develop skills and competencies in its nation. This work explores the possible impacts of the adoption of educational structures and processes; it sets the question, are the issues concerning constructive alignment (Biggs, 1999), accountability to fee payers, utilisation of high level fees, focussing on employability and students drifting into a vocation course, such as computing, not from choice but from persuasive discourses, inhibiting knowledge creation and distribution and the development of professionals, or are our adoptions of practice simply a drive to enable the smooth functioning of our organisations rather than the pursuit of knowledge(Foucault in Fejes and Nicoll, p41,).\\n\\nBiggs, J.

These environments allow novices to navigate a language easily and to construct programs without struggling with the frustrations of syntax.\\n\\nUsing mainstream text-based languages such as Python and Java to teach programming is the norm within computer science and other departments within higher education, and also during the later stages of secondary school. Many students' first taste of programming will therefore be in a textual language; others will need to make the transition from blocks to text.\\n\\nWhatever their prior programming experience, when using a new textual language learners need to cope with an often quite complex syntax and semantics whilst trying to construct working programs. One way to scaffold such learning is by providing a blocks-based environment for constructing programs directly in the text-based language of choice.\\n\\nThis presentation will describe our current progress in the development of PyBlocks, a blocks-based environment for constructing and executing Python programs. The aim of PyBlocks is to close the gap between programming using a simplified blocks-based language and textual programming in a mainstream language popular in education. As well as helping to guarantee the syntactic validity of programs, PyBlocks aims to reduce the occurrence of run-time errors, a source of learner frustration common with dynamic languages, by ensuring that constructed programs remain well-typed during execution. The system also helps demonstrate how data types work in the language by representing them using colours: every expression block in a program is coloured according to its type.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in student learning where the focus has shifted towards knowledge acquisition through learning activities instead of simple knowledge transfer. To facilitate new learning models, students must be facilitated with immersive learning experiences rather than being considered as passive recipients of a teacher-centric knowledge transfer process. This will help them in having the deeper insights to the important concepts of different subjects. With the help of virtual reality (VR), the feeling of being in the learning environment and playing with the learning components can easily be generated. Knowing that VR has found its applications in several fields like military, healthcare etc., it has a great scope in improving the student learning in education domain. In VR-enhanced learning, the students have the flexibility to undergo self-directed learning processes with some strategic feedback mechanisms to further improve their learning capabilities. Particularly, the use of VR in computing courses and labs has a great potential of improving student learning experience and in turns their learning abilities. Especially, the basic concepts in programming languages like, multi-dimensional structures, array, and pointers can be very well understood by the use of VR tools. The better understanding of the basic programming concept can result in better programming skills of the students. In this paper, we discuss the effectiveness of using VR in computing courses. We also compare different off-the-shelf VR tools in regards to their features, suitability, and cost. In addition, an innovative, low-cost solution to simplify multi-dimensional visualizations, while having a positive influence on the student learning and motivation are presented.'},\n",

       "  'title': 'Supporting the learning of programming with the PRIMM approach',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'A range of pedagogical strategies have been suggested to support the teaching of programming, with the goal of improving student outcomes. Research into tracing has suggested that novice learners should focus on small tasks with single elements, with an emphasis on reading and tracing code before they are expected to write code snippets (Teague & Lister, 2014). Other research has concluded that students should be encouraged to predict what a program will do when executed (Busjahn & Schulte, 2013) and an approach known as Use-Modify-Create focuses on running programs provided by someone else before they modify them in order that the modified material gradually becomes ‘theirs’ (Lee et al, 2011). What these strategies have in common is that they provide scaffolding in the learning process and support novice programmers to acquire both a better understanding of programming and confidence in their ability to carry out programming tasks. Without this scaffolding, students who are required to write code in a text-based language too early in their skills development can experience frustration, and a tendency to rely on trial and error. Drawing on these areas of research, we have been trialling a framework for teaching programming called PRIMM (Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make) (Sentance & Waite, 2017). Although designed to support teachers in school we believe that our approach will also have resonance in higher education. In the summer of 2017, we carried out a small pilot study of PRIMM in the classroom with students between age 11 and 15. Six teachers participated for 2-4 weeks and a total of 89 students were involved. As part of the study the teachers kept journals and were then interviewed by researchers. Overall, the teachers reported that students’ understanding had increased by the use of this method, and that it made certain topics more accessible. We consider that this approach could be applied in higher education contexts.\\n'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Self regulated learning is one of the modern educational approaches aiming at improving the student’s motivation and ensuring progressive learning throughout modules. Extrinsic motivation in educational behaviour refers to the desire of learning to attain the desired outcome such as grades out of assignments or final exams; rewards for classroom activity or competition. However, once the rewards are no longer offered or desired outcome has been achieved, student’s interest in the classroom is lost and may require to offer continuous reward to ensure progressive learning in classroom. Intrinsic motivation refers to the student's own desire to learn new things and new challenges and gain knowledge. It has been known that intrinsic motivation produce self-regulated learners/students as they can control their attributes and desires to achieve their goals (not just grades) and master their interest in a particular topic. Videos, research portfolios, seminars and hands on lab experience constitute key resources to be integrated in a balanced and structured way to build student’s intrinsic motivation and ensure progressive learning, particularly in engineering and computing classrooms. Nowadays students are hooked up to videos and it is easier to motivate them to watch learning videos about technology and related concepts/processes. Interviews/documentary or historical videos on the topic help students to understand how engineering and computing technologies and concepts/processes have changed or evolved from previous years till now. Success stories of research showing outcomes the students can achieve are another motivator. Current research portfolio will enable the students on how to develop and solve engineering and computing problems and go beyond the state of the art. Seminars from successful researchers will give students role models and motivation. Experts from industry or other institutions will discuss their practices and broaden students learning and motivation. It also improves students experience and their employability. Finally, achievements demonstrated by hands on experience in labs are also motivators. In short, successful and balanced integration of intrinsic motivation with the student's learning together with extrinsic motivation is key to keep students motivated throughout their learning journey in an engineering and computing classroom.\"},\n",

We found that 39% of the respondents preferred to work alone and 16% of them showed their interest to work in group. This shows that more students prefer to study alone. Our aim in using SRS was to promote student collaboration in order to improve their learning despite the fact they preferred to study independently.

       "  'abstract': \"Articulation partnerships between universities and further education (FE) colleges in Scotland provide paths for students to complete degrees by studying two years at college (Higher National Diploma) and two years at university. These crucial mechanisms for widening access to university have been funded by the Scottish Funding Council since 2013. The Associate Student Project (ASP), based in Edinburgh Napier University's School of Computing, supports the Associate Students throughout these four years of study. In 2017, the first of the scheme’s honours students graduated and the fifth cohort of college students matriculated into first year.\\n\\nThe ASP partners agree articulation routes between specific HND courses, at college, and specific BSc/BEng courses at university, ensuring that, students entering university in third year have the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully complete the upcoming modules. Associate Students are matriculated into the university from their first year at FE college and have a guaranteed place on their university programme. Their student card gives them the same access to resources as other university students, including the libraries, fitness centres, and our 24/7 computing lab. University staff provide workshops and lectures to bridge the gap between the college and university experience, including: visits to colleges to provide academic referencing workshops and support to get paid work placements; opportunities to join lectures at the university; specific open and induction days for direct entry students. Once students are at university, ASP facilitates peer-to-peer support through buddy schemes; pizza lunches provide additional opportunities to chat with peers and staff and identify any specific problems. Throughout, quantitative and qualitative research gathers information about the students' needs and perspectives, around transitioning into university and the usefulness of ASP interventions. This presentation shares the insights from this scheme, as universities strive to widen access, improve graduate diversity, and address ICT skills gaps.\"},\n",

External Examiners confirm that this is not an isolated instance but a recurring theme across many Universities. Research in 2016 found that there was a number of reasons for student absence; one of the major reasons being the inability to successfully transition from FE to HE.\\n\\nThis project redesigned the current induction program and aimed to provide students with the skillset required to successfully make this transition and further develop these skills to facilitate a successful degree outcome. The project had three phases; pre-project, project and post-project. The pre-project phase included typical and traditional induction content.The main project focused on skills to enhance independent thinking, problem-solving, self-efficacy and group dynamics. Students were divided into groups of 2 or 3 and randomly allocated a topic of famous people, computers, software or technological advancements. Each group had to produce a research based summary of on this given topic.\\n\\nThe main objectives were to give students the ability to:\\n* Follow a specific set of instructions in order to solve a problem\\n* Organize and manage working in a group\\n* Carry out an academic literature search and use appropriate referencing\\n* Present a concise summary of their findings using a pre-specified format\\n* Create an appealing and attractive submission\\n* Use a variety of collaborative tools such as Google Drive\\n* Meet the tight project deadline and key sign off (from tutor)\\n\\nThe project generated a visual 'Computing History timeline' display, adding aesthetic value to our School of Computing as well as a showcase to public visitors and our students feel invested as co-creators.\\n\\nThe long-term value would be to embed and develop these initial transition skills throughout the duration of their degree.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Computer Science degree at Middlesex has a very open, flexible structure for teaching and assessment. This was discussed at last year\\'s conference. One of the unintended benefits of this has been the way we have been able to develop activities that historically have been considered as co-curricula, but effectively integrate in a variety of interesting ways. This, in turn, has led to additional benefits and an exciting feedback-loop of development.\\n\\nOne of the challenges facing institutions like Middlesex is developing strategies that align with the national \"employability\" agenda, but recognize the barriers present for many students. For example, students working 50+ hours a week “part-time” to support themselves and their families are often unable to take up placement opportunities. Raising self-esteem amongst our students is challenging: many of them have been labeled as \"low tariff\" and are from backgrounds where they expect employment to be difficult to find, and hence their aspirations are limited.\\n\\nOur approach has been to develop a strategic approach to competitions and outreach that makes these an integrated, if optional, part of our curriculum. By \"outreach\" we do not simply mean working with schools, bit also large public engagement events involving huge numbers of visitors, such as New Scientist Live, The Skills Show and SmashFest. Over the years we have developed to a position where we can quickly assemble teams of up to 100 students capable of working together, across years and programmes, to develop activities, set them up in venues such as the EXCEL Centre, the 02 arena, or City Hall, and engage with visitors over several days. This has led to the emergence of role models amongst the student body, with excellent employment skills, who are developing into potential graduate assistants and keen to help develop future cohorts of students. This, in turn, raises self esteem as the whole student body sees what their friends have achieved.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Conducting meaningful outreach activity in order to widen participation in higher education is a constant challenge for all universities, perhaps particularly so for Russell group institutions where the maintenance of elite academic standards can seemingly run counter to enabling 'fairer' access to degree courses.\\n\\nMany institutions offer a broad variety of widening participation activities, but the focus of many of these activities is to enable those identified as displaying academic merit, but who are from ‘disadvantaged’ backgrounds, to apply to and attend degree courses.\\n\\nMany pupils could display academic merit if they were motivated to reach toward higher education. These young people are typically studying at GCSE and A Level, achieving pass grades, but no higher than 'Cs', thus are ineligible for many undergraduate courses. They have innate potential but little knowledge of Higher Education, consequently lacking the drive to improve academically. Both authors have experience of these students and consider that a new approach to outreach would complement existing provision.\\n\\nA pilot study at Durham University involved visits by pupils of limited academic merit from an academy and an education charity. The aim was for the participants to develop an opinion of higher education; persuasion, marketing and academic challenge (typically associated with widening participation activities) were replaced by immersion, participation and informality.\\n\\nA student led visit to St Mary’s College and an adapted first year lecture in Computer Science, both designed to prompt opinion development, were combined with an informal tour of Durham city. The conclusion in each group was that 50% of pupils stated they would consider higher education, but more importantly each participant expressed an evidence based opinion after their visit. In the Durham context this approach could be rolled out to further departments and colleges, reaching pupils of potential in multiple secondary and tertiary settings.\"},\n",

It is targeted at students who are between Stage 2 and 3 (or have completed Stage 3) of their undergraduate studies in any discipline at the University of Kent. Year in Computing students spend a year studying exclusively within the School of Computing and are taught together as a single cohort.\\n\\nThe programme has concluded its first year and the second cohort is currently well underway. Following last year’s presentation at this conference on the overall programme, we will present a specific intervention: as part of their interview for admission to the Year in Computing, each student is tasked with solving a Bebras challenge puzzle. They are based on problems that computer scientists often encounter but require only logical thinking (http://www.bebras.uk).\\nStudies suggest that puzzles can be used to predict student performance in learning computing (Cooper et al., 2015). They are also a useful way to allow students to experience a computing-related task that can be carried out without any prior exposure to computing.\\nAfter roughly one month of teaching, we conducted a focus group study with some of the students in the programme. We were interested to see how computing-specific articulations have become part of students’ vocabulary. As part of the focus group, students were asked to reflect on the state of their comprehension of computing. They were also asked to solve another Bebras puzzle. Here, the students were able to work together in solving the puzzles. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for traces of computing-specific content in the students’ conversations.\\nWe will present preliminary findings from this study and discuss the use of Bebras puzzles as a predictive factor for students’ disposition to learn computing.'},\n",

       "  'title': 'Managing Plagiarism in Programming Assignments with Blended Assessment and Randomisation',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Plagiarism is a common concern for coursework in many situations, particularly where electronic solutions can be provided e.g. computer programs, and leads to unreliability of assessment. Written exams are often used to try to deal with this, and to increase reliability, but at the expense of validity. One solution, outlined in this paper, is to randomise the work that is set for students so that it is very unlikely that any two students will be working on exactly the same problem set. This also helps to address the issue of students trying to outsource their work by paying external people to complete their assignments for them. We examine the effectiveness of this approach and others (including blended assessment) by analysing the spread of similarity scores across four different introductory programming assignments to find the natural similarity i.e. the level of similarity that could reasonably occur without plagiarism. The results of the study indicate that divergent assessment (having more than one possible solution) as opposed to convergent assessment (only one solution) is the dominant factor in natural similarity. A key area for further work is to apply the analysis to a larger sample of programming assignments to better understand the impact of different features of the assignment design on natural similarity and hence the detection of plagiarism.'},\n",

The peer assessment aspect of student appraisal was judged to be integral to the professional development of degree year students, as well as being helpful in the smooth and economical running of a large, multi-campus, core module. Implementation of this part of the assessment regime was undertaken using the Moodle Workshop tool.\\n\\nThe soft skills component of any subject is always problematic to present to technically based students. In Computing, where topics such as professionalism, ethics and legislation are not only crucial for the students’ careers but also integral to BCS accreditation, the challenges of covering these themes is fundamental to the success of multiple programmes.\\n\\nIn creating a new module to address these subjects multiple criteria were set including:\\n* maintaining student interest levels\\n* creation of materials suitable for delivery to large cohorts\\n* able to be taught over multiple programmes and campuses\\n* flexibility for close examination and discussion of the materials by the student\\n* coverage of the subject in just six weeks\\n\\nTo address these issues a blended delivery model was conceived. Extensive use would be made of features built into the VLE to encourage asynchronous study and discussion.\\n\\nRadically different assessment methods were also piloted. Knowledge based assessment was completed using a specific implementation of a modified immediate feedback assessment technique. The written assessment component was peer marked using a random, anonymous method whereby three members of the multiple cross-campus cohorts marked their peers' submissions.\\n\\n181 students enrolled in the module at five geographically diverse campuses, taught by three different members of staff plus another three for tutorial support. In addition there was one purely online student.\\n\\nThe lessons of the peer assessment aspect of this approach, including results and student and tutor reflections, are covered in this presentation.\\n\"}]"
